## Goal
The grand goal of this project is to build a web app that can intelligently recommend road trip routes, given a number of criteria, such as trip duration, budget, region of interest, must-visit destinations, lodging places, time spent at a given location, etc.

The grand goal is glorious but difficult to implement, requiring front-end website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), back-end database and computation, and even machine learning.

Hence, I break down it into baby steps.

The first baby step is to find the fastest route, given n destinations, powered by JavaScript and Google Maps API.
